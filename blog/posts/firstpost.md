First!
======
This is the first official post on our new blog. Yesterday we hired a new developer [@dustinblackman](https://twitter.com/dustinheroin). Dustin will be tasked with optimizing our scraping/API and MongoDB. We recently applied for [500startups](http://500.co/) and hope to hear back from them in the upcoming weeks. We have finaly moved over to our Softlayer server so this means we SHOULD have less downtime but thanks to Murphy's Law I highly doubt that. Expect lots of minor changes/improvements, a few major changes and one or two new features!

Thats all for now,
