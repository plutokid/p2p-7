OUTPOST API
===========

### app.py
`app.py` is the server if you want to call it that. It runs a Flask server which acts as the middleman between the multiple APIs we scrape/use and the OutpostTravel website.

### outpost.py
`outpost.py` is the library/module used by `app.py` to access the MongoDB server and other APIs.

### *.get.py
`flipkey.get.py` and `roomorama.get.py` the scrapers for both Flipkey and Roomorama respectivly. They each take XML feeds from the providers and parse/insert them into a MongoDB database.
